Images can be saved within a React component and imported to a component.

Vocab
- assets file - file where you save all your images

Importing an image:
- Create a file called assets, and save and rename files appropriately.  Make sure to keep these names lowercase.
- In App.js, you want to import images in the top, similar to how you would when importing another component.  Include the file path as well.
