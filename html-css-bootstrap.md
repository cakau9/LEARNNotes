HTML is the structure 
Anatomy:
<h1> Content</h1>
    - <h1> opening tag
    - </h1> closing tag
    - Content is the content that is to be displayed on the page
- Typically want only one H1 tag
 Link Anatomy:
    links = <a href= "www.google.com">Link</a>
        - google.com is an attribute
- <div></div> => controls everything around it

Form HTML
- <form></form>
- <input>
- <labels>

CSS is what gives HTML color, more bells and whistles etc.
For CSS:
- class . => classes are reusable
- id # => ids are unique

- W3 Schools good resource for HTML/CSS
- command + / will apply comment in HTML
- SEO - search engine optimization
